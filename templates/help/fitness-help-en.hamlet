<h2 #travel-help>Travel Types

<p>
  The travel type is a broad description of how you intend to travel the Camino.
  The type is used to estimate the amount of time it will take you to walk a (possibly hilly) segment of the way.
  The type is also used to help provide defaults for the sort of services you might need along the way and the daily distance traveled.
  Generally, people either walk or use a bicycle.

        <td>Walking the Camino.
            This option uses a rule to calculate the time taken to travel a given distance
            that takes account of the need to slow down on steep descents.
            This is the default travel type.

        <td>Walking the Camino for powerful walkers.
            This option uses a rule to calculate the time taken to travel a given distance
            that works for very capable walkers who will not slow up when descending a steep slope.
    <tr>
        <td>^{caminoTravelIcon Cycling}
        <td>_{caminoTravelMsg Cycling}
        <td>Cycling the Camino.
            This option uses a rule for cycling, with more attention paid to levels of fitness.
            It is still undergoing testing.

<h2 #fitness-help>Fitness

<p>
  Fitness is a broad estimate of how long you can keep up a consistent walking or cycling pace.
  Most legs on the Camino take five to eight hours and you can get pretty tired and footsore along the way.
  The fitness level allows the planner to make allowances for the inevitable slowing of pace as you weary.
  See
  <a href="#estimating-fitness">below
  for information on how to estimate fitness.

<p>
  <em>Beware of over-estimating your fitness.</em>
  "Normal" fitness is someone in their 20s or 30s who has trained for long walks.

<h3 #estimating-fitness>Estimating Fitness

<p>
  The planner uses as set of corrections, called Tranter's corrections, to account for fitness levels.
  The standard definition for fitness levels is the amount of time it takes to climb 1000 feet (300m) over half a mile (800m).
  For example, using the following table, if it took you 25 minutes to climb 1000 feet, you would be classified as fit.
  Another way to estimate fitness is to measure the time you can walk at a nominal 5km/hr (or 3mi/hr) before noticeably tiring.

  Cyclists can estimate fitness based on road-speed and VAM (velocit√† ascensionale media or average ascent speed).
